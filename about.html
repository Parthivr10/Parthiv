    <p id="aboutme">I'm Parthiv R, a third year computer science and engineering student at college of engineering karunagappally. I'm a passionate web developer who is always curious about technologies and focused on learning new things. My passion in sketching made me a good adobe illustrator. Being a part of different communities and clubs made me realise the importance of volunteering and help me to mould to a better person.</p>
